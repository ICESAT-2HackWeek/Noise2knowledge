# WaterNoice

### Data Science Objective
Do they residual histograms of ATL06 data vary across different hydrologic features (meltwater ponds, 
known firn aquifers, blue ice, etc.)
And if so, characterize how this variability through space and time.

### Datasets
- ICESat-2 [ATL06](https://nsidc.org/data/atl06?qt-data_set_tabs=3#qt-data_set_tabs) (20 m resolution)
- REMA: 2 m digital elevation data for Antarctica
- Sentinel-1 and LANDSAT imagery data for identifying perennial surface features

### Validation Datasets


### Tools
python
jupyter notebooks

### Tasks
- Learn how to download the ICESat-2 data by lat lon bounding box
- explore parameters associated with level 6 data - gain familarity 
- develop pipeline for subsetting data and downloading ICESat-2 ATL06
- develop first order filtering for each region
- exploratory statistics that describe differences in key parameters between different water features
- develop python code for plotting results
- what are the big takeaways? Running document of key findings to share with hackweek group

### Study Sites:
- Store Glacier, west Greenland
- Firn aquifer region in southeast Greenland (near Helheim)
- Amery ice shelf melt water ponds
- RBIS (east Antarctica)
